Hey,
Im nerfedbygod 
(the username is cause i have horrific eyesight, and my joke is "i was so OP in the beta, god nerfed my eyes")

Im probably not gonna make much here, 
and if i do its probably cause i wrote something that i need to give to a friend. 
Right now, i know Python and ive been doing a lot with Linux shell scripts and aliases.
